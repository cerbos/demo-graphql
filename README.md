# Demo GraphQL

This project showcases using Cerbos inside of a GraphQL server.

## Setup

- Have Node v12+ on your machine (recommend using NVM)
- Ensure your docker is setup to pull `ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:0.0.0-alpha1`
- Run `npm install`

## Running

Cerbos is running seperately in a docker container to the application and served on `http://localhost:9999`. To start this run `cerbos/start.sh`

To boot the GraphQL server run `npm run start`

Once running, you can access GraphQL Playground `http://localhost:5000/graphql`
