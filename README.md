# Demo GraphQL

This project showcases using Cerbos inside of a GraphQL server. The server is written in typescript and makes used of [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com/) to create the schema and resolvers.

## Setup

- Have Node v12+ on your machine (recommend using NVM)
- Ensure your Docker is setup to pull `ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:0.17.0`
- Run `npm install` to get the node dependencies.

## Running

Cerbos is running separately in a docker container to the application and served on http://localhost:3592. To start this run `cd cerbos && ./start.sh`

To boot the GraphQL server run `npm run start`

Once running, you can access GraphQL Playground [http://localhost:5000/graphql](http://localhost:5000/graphql)

- `key:zeena:sales` is an North America sales person
- `key:john:manager-emea` is an EMEA Manager in sales
- `key:brock:manager-na` is an North America Manager in sales
